# Homebrew Libindy

Simple install script for libindy.

## Warning

It currently does not work for Apple devices with apple silicon. 
Currently there is a PR open for a fix for this, so hopefully it will soon be resolved.

## Usage

```bash
brew tap blu3beri/homebrew-libindy
brew intall libindy
```
